/**
 * This server just provides REST APIs to run the chat application
 * No one gives a fuck about server but I kind of do. So here is what I plan to
 * do.
 * 1. Connect a DB with the server
 * 2. Write the login/signup api
 * 3. Based on the login user I am gonna generate a session which will be stored in some DB(redis most probably.)
